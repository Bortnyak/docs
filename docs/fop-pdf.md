The most common way to print pdf report from jsreport is to use [phantom-pdf](http://jsreport.net/learn/phantom-pdf) recipe and let it convert html into pdf. This is very productive but sometimes you want to have better control over pdf rendering. In this case you should consider using `Fop-pdf` recipe. `Fop-pfg` recipe is using [apache fop](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) to print pdf reports. The report must be defined using special xml format called [fo](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/fo.html). This format can be nicely combined with [templating engines](http://jsreport.net/learn/templating-engines) to dynamically assemble report definition.

`fop-pdf` is running on [playground](https://playground.jsreport.net) and [jsreport online](https://jsreportonline.net) but you need to explicitly install it for your on-prem jsreport server. To fullfill this you need to download [apache fop](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) and java and also add its locations into your executable PATH environment variable.
