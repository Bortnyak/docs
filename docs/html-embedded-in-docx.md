## Installation
```bash
npm install jsreport-html-embedded-in-docx
```

## Basics
The `html-embedded-in-docx` recipe takes the `html` output and embeds it into the docx based report. This is very straight forward way to generate docx/word reports from jsreport. However please note that such output docx file cannot be opened in some Office implementations like `Open Office`.

## Preview in studio
