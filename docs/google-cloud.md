## Virtual Machines
This the most common option. Launch a new VM and use the installation manuals for [Ubuntu](/learn/ubuntu), [Windows](/learn/windows) or [Docker](https://jsreport.net/learn/docker). The size of the VM requirement is relative to your expected load. 

## Functions
You can run jsreport also as [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions). See the [dedicated tutorial here](/learn/gcloud-functions-serverless) for the details. 

## Kubernetes
You can use our official jsreport docker image and extend it to your needs.
