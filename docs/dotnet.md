[asp.net MVC application with full .NET framework using Razor views and local jsreport](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport-dotnet-example-net-webapp)   

Never seen jsreport in action? You can also browse jsreport demos in the [online playground](https://playground.jsreport.net) or see short [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf8-SdGjsdo).

## Documentation

Navigate to the particular section based on your needs. If you are starting or planning to run jsreport inside your .NET application you should the first start with [local jsreport in .NET](/learn/dotnet-local)  section. If you already have jsreport or jsreportonline running and you only need to connect to its API, you should navigate to [remote jsreport API client](/learn/dotnet-client).

[local jsreport in .NET](/learn/dotnet-local)
[remote jsreport API client](/learn/dotnet-client)
[asp.net MVC jsreport filters](/learn/dotnet-aspnetcore)

It is also valuable to get some general knowledge about jsreport and its concepts. There are tons of resources in the [learn](/learn) section including [get started](/learn/get-started) tutorial.

## How does it work

jsreport nuget package embeds the [jsreport binary](/learn/single-file-executable) and provide convenient c# API on the top of it. This allows to run jsreport directly from the .NET projects without other dependencies or external servers required. This gives you do power to do pretty much everything jsreport supports in very convenient way.
